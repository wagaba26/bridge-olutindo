# Homepage Foundation Plan

## Goal
Create a clean homepage skeleton that is easy to expand later without introducing clutter.

## Header Pattern
- Top utility row:
  - Left: search icon entry to resources
  - Center: brand wordmark
  - Right: language toggle and menu button
- Category row (desktop):
  - `Learn / Study / Partners / Resources`
  - neutral text links with clear active state

## Homepage Logic Order
1. Hero:
   - One core message
   - Two actions only
   - One supporting visual
2. Spotlight cards:
   - Study route spotlight
   - Partnership spotlight
3. Method block:
   - One infographic system (Assess -> Train -> Certify)
4. Resources block:
   - One featured guide
   - Small latest list

## Expansion Slots (future sections)
- Slot A (below hero): outcomes or testimonials
- Slot B (below spotlights): pricing/program comparison
- Slot C (above resources): FAQ or trust indicators

## Rules to Keep It Clean
- No repeated navigation labels inside page body.
- Maximum 2 primary actions per section.
- Each section must answer one question only.
- If a section duplicates existing meaning, merge or remove.
